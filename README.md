# Trojan_Detection
This repo contains code, processed datasets, and trained models from the paper:  
“Robust Hardware Trojan Detection Leveraging Dual-Domain Features and Stacked Ensemble Learning.”

## Overview

We present a non-invasive, pre-silicon framework for detecting stealthy hardware Trojans using combined time- and frequency-domain features and a stacked ensemble classifier. The system is validated on real power-trace data.

## What’s Included

- Feature datasets for six Trojan types (AES-T500, AES-T600, AES-T700, AES-T800, AES-T1300 and AES-T1600)
-  Traditional models, Deep Learning models  and Ensemble models
- Training and evaluation scripts

## Setup & Run
git clone https://github.com/puspa314/Trojan_Detection.git
cd Trojan_Detection
pip install -r requirements.txt

run the scripts with Jupyter Notebbok
